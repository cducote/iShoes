# Shoesie

### An app that determines if the user can justify a new pair of shoesies

## Overview

For project 2, I created an app that allows a user to justify a pair of shoes on a low income budget

Once the user loads the home page, they are presented with instructions on how to move forward after creating a user name or selecting one if they have already created one. After creating a new 'shoesie' profile they arrive on their 'shoesie page' and proceed to follow through with the instructions given by filling out the forms on each page for 'shoe price', 'bills', and 'income', once complete the app will tell the user true or false on whether or not they can afford they shoe they desire.
